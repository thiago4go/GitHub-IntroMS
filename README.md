1 - Create a branch (A short, descriptive branch name.)  

2 - Make changes  (Commit and push your changes to your branch. Give each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains.)  

3 - Create a pull request (When you create a pull request, include a summary of the changes and what problem they solve.)  

4 - Address review comments (Reviewers should leave questions, comments, and suggestions. Reviewers can comment on the whole pull request or add comments to specific lines.)  

5 - Merge your pull request (Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on the default branch.)

6 - Delete your branch (After you merge your pull request, delete your branch. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches)
